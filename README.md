# AlgEng

The code is written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Prerequisites

- rust
- make

## Usage

Just like the assignment required it, simply copy the needed files into this folder and run

```bash
make
```

This should hopefully call (all paths are hardcoded for now)

```bash
cargo run --release
```
